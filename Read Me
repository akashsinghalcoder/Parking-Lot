So current assumptions for design
1. There are three types of vehicles - bike, car, truck
2. Bike can be parked in small space
3. Car can be parked in compact space
4. Bus can be parked in large space
5. No vehicle will be parked in other space even if it is available
6. Vehicle is identified by basic integer value right now
7. Parking Space is also identified by basic integer value right now
8. Two types of vehicles are differentiated inside logic only(For example bike can have its vehicleNumber =1 and truck can also have its vehicle number = 1. So to differentiate, we check the size of vehicle every time and have written logic accordingly)
We have to know the available parking space.

Class names
Driver - someone like ticket provider who is exposed to client
Client - which contains main class (edited) 
Rest are self explanatory I guess
